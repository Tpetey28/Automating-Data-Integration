# Automating-Data-Integration

This project was created as a final project for the Advanced Data Management course I took at WGU. For the assignment, I was given access to a sample database hosted 
on a postgreSQL server. I was tasked with going through the tables in the database, and coming up with a real-world business report that could be created from the data sets. 

Please see the Business Report Summary file for a complete business report detailing the plan for the report and what it will accomplish.

Thanks for reading! :)
